This project is designed to rank memes based on popularity and apply a fictional
value to them. The main goal is to have the ability to trade them like a stock
market where the price is determined based on the popularity, initially I am
thinking the way to do this is to cross reference reddit with imgur and determine
a formula for "price" based on upvote/like to downvote/dislike ratio factoring
in the share ratio. The next part, I plan to start everyone with a base amount
of money so that they can start buying and selling immediately, additionally,
do not want real world money playing a factor so I plan to develop some kind of
clicker game to go along with it where depending on your clicking you can gain
in game money to buy more with. Will try to think of a way around macros that
simulate many clicks per second.
